# Leaflet-Challenge 

# Earthquake and Tectonic Plate Visualization

# Overview

This project visualizes earthquake data and tectonic plate boundaries using Leaflet.js, D3.js, and Mapbox. The map includes interactive features such as different base layers, color-coded earthquake depths, and tectonic plate overlays.

# Features

- Earthquake Data: Displays earthquake locations with color-coded markers based on depth and magnitude.

- Tectonic Plate Boundaries: Overlays plate boundaries for a better understanding of seismic activity.

- Interactive Controls: Users can switch between different map styles and toggle earthquake and plate boundary layers.

- Legend & Styling: Markers include a white border, color-coded depth, and a responsive legend for clarity.

# Setup Instructions

# Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Git

- Node.js & npm (optional, if using a local server)

# Usage

1. Part 1: Earthquake Visualization

- Loads real-time earthquake data from the USGS API.

- Each earthquake is represented by a circle scaled by magnitude and colored by depth.

- A legend explains the depth color scale.

2. Part 2: Tectonic Plates & Base Maps (Optional Challenge)

- Overlays tectonic plate boundaries on the map.

- Adds multiple base layers (Satellite, Grayscale, Outdoors).

- Includes layer control toggles to show/hide datasets.
